		  <h6 class="w3-opacity"><b>Abstract</b></h6>
          <p>Assembly line balancing problems (ALBPs) involve assigning tasks to stations along an assembly line while satisfying precedence constraints. Increasing production complexity, such as multi-sided layouts and human-robot collaboration, has created variants that are challenging to solve efficiently with existing exact optimisation methods. Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) remains the most common exact approach; however, many MILP formulations rely on Big-M constraints and exhibit symmetry, often resulting in slow solve times and difficulty proving optimality. Recent advances in constraint programming (CP) suggest it may offer a stronger alternative for highly constrained scheduling problems.<br>This thesis examines six ALBP variants: the simple problem (SALBP-1), two two-sided problems (TALBP-1, TALBP-2), and three human-robot collaboration problems (HRALBP-1, HRALBP-2, HRALBP-3). State-of-the-art MILP models from the literature were catalogued, analysed, and improved by strengthening time and precedence constraints and reducing symmetry. New CP formulations were then developed to exploit the built-in scheduling constraints of the chosen CP solver and reduce or eliminate Big-M constraint usage. Computational experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the improved MILP models outperform existing formulations, reducing solution time and increasing optimality rates. However, CP consistently outperforms both baseline and improved MILP models. For example, in TALBP-1, CP solved all benchmark instances optimally, while MILP variants solved only 10 and 18 of the same 35 instances. Overall, this thesis shows that CP provides a more scalable exact optimisation framework for complex assembly line balancing problems and introduces a unified modelling approach that supports multiple ALBP variants.</p>

		  <h6 class="w3-opacity"><b>Abstract</b></h6>
          <p>In this paper, I investigate the optimisation of fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) passive optical distribution networks through mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. Building upon existing single-splitting (SSP), double-splitting (DSP), and mixed-splitting (MSP) models, I propose a novel extension termed the Type-R formulation, which allows dynamic selection of splitting ratios for optical splitters. This modified formulation introduces greater flexibility into the network design and provides additional cost saving by more precisely matching splitter capacity to demand. Computational experiments on randomly generated large-scale network instances demonstrate that the Type-R formulations consistently yield lower objective costs compared to fixed-ratio models, albeit at the expense of increased computation time. Notably, the single-splitting Type-R model (SSP-R) achieves the most favourable trade-off between cost efficiency and solution time, outperforming both standard (MSP) and Type-R mixed-splitting models (MSP-R). These findings suggest that Type-R formulations offer a promising direction for more cost-effective FTTH network deployment, particularly in large-scale settings.</p>

		  <h6 class="w3-opacity"><b>Abstract</b></h6>
          <p>In this project, we implemented and extended three linear optimization models from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2024.04.034">de Moor et al. (2024)</a> to optimize food aid supply chains in Syria. The Nominal Optimization (NO), Robust Optimization (RO), and Pareto Robust Optimization (PRO) models were applied to minimize operational costs while meeting nutritional requirements in uncertain market conditions. We identified a key limitation in the original models, where nutrient shortfalls defaulted to the maximum allowed level. To improve this, we introduced blended objective functions that balanced cost reduction with shortfall minimization. Implementation was carried out in Python using Gurobi, with testing on historical market data. Our results showed that the NO model was computationally efficient and scalable, while the RO and PRO models presented challenges due to large matrix structures and non-convex quadratic constraints. This work offers a practical framework for NGOs to balance cost efficiency and nutritional adequacy in food aid planning.</p>
